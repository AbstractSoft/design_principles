# SOLID design principles

This repository section contains examples written in C# of the five SOLID design principles of object-oriented programming. Each example has a "after" and "before" version to demonstrate adherence to and violation of the principle, respectively.

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
